# Code Challenge 7

**Assignment**
Extend your LinkedList implementation by adding a new method.

    KthFromEnd: This method takes a number, "k", as a parameter. It should return the value of the node that is k places from the end of the linked list. You can assume that the linked list has at least k nodes.
